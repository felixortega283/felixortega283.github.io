Welcome to this incredibly simple website using very basic html! This
          is also how a website would look like in the 90s! Usually modern
          websites look so nice! They have these amazing style sheets. For now
          this website is pretty simple but it is a part of a long term project
          where I learn more about web development and eventually make this
          website into a beautifully designed portfolio.

Here's screenshots of websites from the 90s that I found online!

This is the brand new user interface; this time, my website actually looks like a blog! Again,
        I'm planning on improving this user interface. I want to find a way to archive versions of my website.
        Right now, I have no idea, so instead, I'm going to post an image instead.

It's been a while since I've posted here because of school, but anyways I've decided
        to try using Neovim. It kind of makes me look like a hacker because of the fact that I'm 
        doing all of this from the terminal. I honestly think it looks pretty cool. Here's an image of 
        me writing this blog post! Pretty soon, I'm going to change this blog post system into something
        more dynamic. See ya then!
